# Exercise 1-13

We wish to demonstrate that $F(n)$ is the closest integer to
$\frac{\phi^n}{\sqrt 5}$ for all $n > 0$, where $\phi$ is the golden ratio and
$F(n)$ is the $n$th Fibonnaci number.

Observe that this is equivalent to demonstrating the relation

$$
\begin{equation}
F(n) = \frac{\phi^n - \psi^n}{\sqrt 5}
\end{equation}
$$

holds for $n > 1$, as
$\frac{\psi^n}{\sqrt 5} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}\phi^n} < \frac{1}{2}$
for all $n > 1$.

We'll use the lazy proof by induction, since that's the suggested way in the
solutions. The direct proof is fairly more involved.

## Proof

### Base case

We must prove that it holds for the base cases $n = 0$ and $n = 1$.

$$
F(0) = \frac{\phi^0 - \psi^0}{\sqrt 5} = 0\\
F(1) = \frac{\phi - \psi}{\sqrt 5} = \frac{\sqrt 5}{\sqrt 5} = 1
$$

Thus we have shown the inductive hypothesis holds for the base cases.

### Inductive step

Now assuming the inductive hypothesis holds for any $n$ and $n - 1$, we
demonstrate that it directly implies that the inductive hypothesis holds for
$n+1$.

$$
\begin{split}
F(n+1) &= F(n) + F(n - 1)
	\\ &= \frac{\phi^n - \psi^n + \phi^{n-1} - \psi^{n-1}}{\sqrt 5}
	\\ &= \frac{\phi^{n-1}(\phi + 1) - \psi^{n-1}(\psi + 1)}{\sqrt 5}
	\\ &= \frac{\phi^{n-1}(\phi^2) - \psi^{n-1}(\psi^2)}{\sqrt 5}
	\\ &= \frac{\phi^{n+1} - \psi^{n+1}}{\sqrt 5}
\end{split}
$$

Thus, given the inductive hypothesis holds for any $n$, $n-1$, it also
necessarily holds any $n+1$, proving the inductive step. Since the base cases
and the inductive step have been proven, it follows by mathematical induction
that the proposition holds for any $n>1$. $\blacksquare$

## Aside

Damn textbook authors just love this proof, even though almost every exercise is
just a proof by induction (which doesn't really teach you much other than how to
write proofs by induction). I do this exercise probably twice a year just from
random encounters with textbook exercises.
