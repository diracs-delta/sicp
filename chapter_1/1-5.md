The line

```
(define (p) (p))
```

defines an infinitely recursive circular reference. Evaluation of `(p)` will
result in an infinite loop.

Under *applicative-order substitution*, the expression `(test 0 (p))` results in
an infinite loop because the interpreter will evaluate `(p)` prior to
substituing the arguments into the body of `test`.

Under *normal-order substitution*, arguments are substituted prior to
evaluation, meaning that `(p)` is first substituted into the body of `test`,
resulting in evaluation of the expression

```
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
```

Because we assume the special form `if` behaves as-expected regardless of
substitution model, the above expression results in return of the consequent
expression `0`. `(p)` is never evaluated in normal-order substitution, hence an
infinite loop never occurs.
