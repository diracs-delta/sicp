Because the interpreter does not recognize `new-if` as a special form, the
interpreter applies the general evaluation rule to the `new-if` expression while
treating `new-if` as a standard compound procedure.

This means that the interpreter evaluates the arguments of `new-if` prior to
substitution. However, because `sqrt-iter` is called recursively in the
alternative expression, the evaluation of the alternative expression results in
an infinite loop.

This would not happen with a `cond` expression, as `cond` is a special form that
only defers evaluation of the consequent and alternative expressions until the
conditional has been evaluated.
