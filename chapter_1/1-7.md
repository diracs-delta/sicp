Using an absolute difference in body of `good-enough?` results in failure for
both small and large numbers for two reasons.

- For small numbers, the absolute error of 0.001 can be too large relative to
the actual value, leading to an imprecise result.

- For large numbers, the absolute error of 0.001 can be too small relative to
the degree of precision capable of being expressed in large numbers. In each
iteration of the procedure body, the guess may vary by more than 0.001 due to
the limitations of *relative precision* for decimal numbers, which results in an
infinite loop.

By rewriting the body of `good-enough?` to only reflect the *relative
difference* between the previous guess and the current guess, the new `sqrt`
procedure works well for the small and large cases that caused the old `sqrt`
procedure to either return an imprecise result or result in an infinite loop.
