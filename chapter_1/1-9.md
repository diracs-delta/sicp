`(+ 4 5)` is evaluated in the first procedure as follows:

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```

`(+ 4 5)` is evaluated in the second procedure as follows:

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
(+ 3 6)
(+ (dec 3) (inc 6))
(+ 2 7)
(+ (dec 2) (inc 7))
(+ 1 9)
(+ (dec 1) (inc 8))
(+ 0 9)
9
```

As you can see above, the first procedure is a recursive process while the
second procedure is an iterative process.

Something I learned from this exercise that is really cool: in a language that
uses applicative-order substitution:

- If a recursive procedure defines itself as an argument to another procedure,
then it must be a recursive process, as evaluation of the enclosing expression
must be deferred.

- Otherwise, it is an iterative process.
