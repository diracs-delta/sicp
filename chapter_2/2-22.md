During each iteration of the first procedure, the squared element is inserted
at index 0 to the `answer` list, rather than being appended to the end. Hence,
the list is in reverse.

```scheme
(square-list (list 1 2 3 4 5))
(iter (1 2 3 4 5) nil)
(iter (2 3 4 5) (1))
(iter (3 4 5) (4 1))
(iter (4 5) (9 4 1))
(iter (5) (16 9 4 1))
(iter () (25 16 9 4 1))
(25 16 9 4 1)
```

In the second procedure, it is attempting to naively append the squared element
simply by doing `(cons answer (square (car things)))`. This will not actually
append the element to `answer`, but rather construct a new pair whose first
element is `answer` and whose second element is `(square (car things))`.

```scheme
(square-list (list 1 2 3 4 5))
(iter (1 2 3 4 5) nil)
(iter (2 3 4 5) (nil 1))
(iter (3 4 5) ((nil 1) 4))
(iter (4 5) (((nil 1) 4) 9))
(iter (5) ((((nil 1) 4) 9) 16))
(iter () (((((nil 1) 4) 9) 16) 25))
(((((nil 1) 4) 9) 16) 25)
```
