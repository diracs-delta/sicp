To show that the definitions are correct, we must demonstrate that for any two
numbers `a`, `b`, evaluation of `(car (cons a b)) = a` and `(cdr (cons a b)) =
b`. These are the only two conditions that a pair must satisfy.

Using normal-order substitution and the custom implementation we defined in 2-4,
we find:

```scheme
(car (cons a b))
((cons a b) (lambda (p q) p))
((lambda (m) (m a b)) (lambda (p q) p))
((lambda (p q) p) a b)
a
```

Similarly,

```scheme
(cdr (cons a b))
((cons a b) (lambda (p q) q))
((lambda (m) (m a b)) (lambda (p q) q))
((lambda (p q) q) a b)
b
```

Showing evaluation with application-order substitution is more tricky, since the
lambda expression actually evaluate to an unnamed procedure that is difficult to
represent in text.
