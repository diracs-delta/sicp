a) The two procedures produce the same lists:

```
'(1 3 5 7 9 11)
'(1 3 5 7 9 11)
'(1 3 5 7 9 11)
```

The only difference is that the first builds "left-to-right" while the second
builds "right-to-left".

b) The first procedure has $O(n \lg n)$ complexity because `append` runs in
$O(n)$ time and is called at each level of recursion, of which there are $\lg
n$. The second procedure does not have this shortcoming, and can run at $O(n)$
time.
