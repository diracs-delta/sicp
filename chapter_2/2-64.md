a) `partial-tree` finds the median of the list (`(car non-left-elts)`), and
builds the left tree out of all elements prior (whose length is `left-size`) and
the right tree out of all elements after (`(cdr non-left-elts)`). This process
is then repeated recursively for the left and right subtrees.

Thus, this builds a BST when given an ordered list.

b) $O(n)$.
