In the special case of 2.71, each iteration of the recursive process to encode a
symbol reduces the problem size by 1 and takes $O(n)$ time to complete. Hence,
in the worst case, we are encoding the least-frequent symbol in tree, and need
to run $n$ iterations, resulting in $O(n^2)$ time complexity.
