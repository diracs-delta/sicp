When new types are added:

- Generics with explicit dispatch require new clauses in every generic procedure
  to handle the new type.

- Data-directed styles require each operation to handle the new type,
  meaning every row in the operation-type table needs to be editted.

- Message passing style allows for direct addition of the new type without
  touching any other types or operations, since the type handles all operations on
  its own internally.

When new operations are added:

- With generics, a new generic procedure must be defined that explicitly
  dispatches based on type.

- With data-directed styles, a new operation can be added as a "row" to the
  operation-type table without touching any other operations.

- With message-passing style, a new operation requires every type to be editted
  to handle the new operation.

Data-directed style is most appropriate when new operations are frequently
added, while message-passing style is most appropriate when new types are
frequently added.
