This works because this recursive definition for operators acting on complex
numbers simply removes the `complex` type tag, and allows `magnitude` to
dispatch based on the second type tag, which is either `polar` or `rectangular`.

```scheme
(magnitude z) ;; z has type tag of complex
(apply-generic 'magnitude z)
(magnitude (contents z)) ;; (contents z) has type tag of polar or rectangular
(apply-generic 'magnitude (contents z))
;; => evaluates to magnitude defined within polar or rectangular package
```

`apply-generic` is evaluated twice when evaluating the magnitude of a complex
number.
