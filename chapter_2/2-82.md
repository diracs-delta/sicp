Suppose we have three types: `A`, `B`, `C`. Furthermore suppose we have 3
variables `a`, `b`, `c` with types `A`, `B`, `C` resp.

Given the coercions:

```
C => A
B => C
```

And an operation `op` that accepts parameters of types `A`, `C`, and `A`,
respectively:

```
(op A C A)
```

The strategy described would not be able to evaluate `(op a b c)` because it
only attempts to coerce to one type at a time. In this example, both coercions
need to be applied to arrive at a suitable set of types for `op`, but both
coercions coerce to different types.
