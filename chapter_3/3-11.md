The local state (i.e. the internal `balance` binding) for `acc` is kept in the
frame created upon invocation of `make-account` with the argument `50`.
Successive invocations of `make-account`, such as that used to define `acc2`,
create entirely separate frames with their own internal `balance` binding.
These frames are all subordinate to the global environment.

Hence, the only environment structure shared between `acc` and `acc2` is the
global environment, which contains the bindings for:

- all primitive procedures

- `make-account`

- `acc` and `acc2`
